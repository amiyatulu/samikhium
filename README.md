### A decentralized blogging and video sharing platform without information pollution      
Samikhium is a blogging and video app, build on coordination games to separate fake, misleading, and redundant information from quality content. It incentivizes only quality original content as per the scientific guidelines, not low-quality redundant information that causes information overload. Samikhium does not incentivize based on page views, or likes, dislikes, which can be easily hacked by producing clickbait titles, for paying for likes, dislikes, or more page views.
